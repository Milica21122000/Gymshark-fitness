			<h1>Breakfast</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>Each day includes three meals and three snacks and has a healthy balance of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. You'll also get plenty of fiber from whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes.
			Feel free to add more water, coffee, or herbal tea to any day, but keep in mind that adding cream or sugar also adds calories. It's OK to swap out similar menu items, but keep cooking methods in mind.


            Replacing a sirloin steak with grilled chicken is fine, for instance, but replacing it with chicken-fried steak isn't going to work because of the breading changes the fat, carb and sodium countsâ€”and the calories. Finally, you can adjust your calorie intake by eliminating snacks if you want to lose weight or eating larger snacks if you want to gain weight.</p>
