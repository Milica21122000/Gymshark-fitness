		<p>Gymshark opened in March 2013. From day one, we have dedicated ourselves to delivering tailored fitness strategies that incorporate consistent training and nutrition into a lifestyle-centered approach. We stand apart by prioritizing sustainable results in a market overly focused on intensity and quick fixes. 

        Our membership is comprised of a community of like-minded people who strive to improve their health and happiness one percent every day, both in and outside of the gym. The FIT Lab team is invested in helping each member achieve their goals while improving their overall quality of life.</p>
        
        <h1 class="naslov1">Our Mission</h1>
        
        <p>Leave no doubt how much we care, from the first interaction to the last. We are dedicated to helping our members achieve real, sustainable results through tailored fitness programs and ongoing support.</p>

        <h1 class="naslov1">Our Approach</h1>
        
        <p>The Gymshark offers personal One-on-one and Small-group Training with an experienced team of coaches, in an environment built on a foundation of respect, knowledge, safety, and professionalism. Our comprehensive approach integrates science-based strength-training workouts, nutrition coaching, and remote support via our members-only communication hub.

        We pride ourselves on honesty and transparency. In that spirit, we expect our members to hold themselves accountable. Achieving fitness and health goals requires more than just showing up. Prioritizing nutrition, stress management, sleep, and daily motion every day plays a critical role in success. We take our members’ fitness and health seriously and expect them to do the same. That’s why we provide the resources, motivation, and support when it comes to these priorities – in addition to smart, kick-ass workouts in a fun and positive environment.</p>

        <h1 class="naslov1">Giving Back</h1>
        
        <p>Giving back to the community is a core value of The Gymshark. Each month, we make a donation to a charity chosen by the winners of our Fitness Challenge. Additionally, in Spring 2019 we rallied our whole community and partnered with Hoboken Prime Cycle to raise more than $5,000 for the HEART 9/11 organization.</p>

			<h1 class="naslov2" style="color: white">Jason Bowen</h1>
			<p class="text">
				<span>What members have to say about Jason:</span>

				“[Jason is] an amazing and fun trainer. In group sessions, he’s incredibly engaging and explains each circuit in great detail. He’s attentive to form and lets you know exactly what muscles you should be feeling with each movement. I’m never struggling to understand what I should be doing at my workout sessions.” <br><br>

				<span>About Jason</span><br><br>

				After a successful career in finance, Jason made the leap into the fitness industry when The Gymshark launched in 2013.  

                Jason, who is National Association of Sports Medicine (NASM) and Functional Movement Screen (FMS) certified, is keenly aware of the benefits that physical wellness brings to busy, stressed professionals. His desire to help people was ignited after shoulder surgery years ago. During his lengthy recovery, he gained considerable insights as well as the ability to relate to clients after his experience regaining strength, shedding excess weight, and resolving many common aches and pains.

		<h1 class="naslov2" style="color: white">Kathleen Livelli</h1>
		<p class="text">
			
			<span>About Kathleen</span><br><br>


			Kathleen views the gym as a positive environment for building strength and confidence for everyone – no matter their background or starting level. She’s a proponent for workouts that are both fun and challenging. Her goal is to help members of The Gymshark unlock their potential, move better, get stronger, and walk out of each workout feeling energized.

            Staying active has been important to Kathleen since her high school days of running hurdles on the track team. Though she can boast impressive  accomplishments including a sprint triathlon and climbing Pike’s Peak, she is proudest of the many small, daily actions that contribute to maintaining a healthy, sustainable lifestyle in a fast-paced world. As a professional in renewable energy by day, Kathleen is always looking for practical ways to incorporate movement between gym workouts and and to maintain clean eating while at her desk.
